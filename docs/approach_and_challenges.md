# Approach
## 1. Understanding the Task
The first step was to carefully read and understand the requirements provided by the user. This included identifying the key components of the task and the expected deliverables.
## 2. Breaking Down the Task
I broke down the task into smaller, more manageable subtasks. This helped in organizing the work and ensuring that all requirements were addressed systematically.
## 3. Research and Planning
Before starting the implementation, I conducted research to identify suitable tools, and methodologies for the task. This involved exploring existing solutions, documentation, and best practices.
## 4. Implementation
I implemented the solution by following best coding practices and using the required technologies. This involved writing clean, modular, and maintainable code while adhering to the principles of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and SOLID (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion).
## 5. Testing
After implementing the solution, I thoroughly tested it to ensure that it met the specified requirements and produced the expected outcomes. This involved both manual testing and automated testing using PHPUnit.
## 6. Documentation
I created comprehensive documentation to explain how to use the solution, including setup instructions, and usage examples. This documentation aimed to make it easy for users to understand and utilize the solution effectively.

# Challenges Faced
## 1. Setting Up Docker
Configuring Docker and Docker Compose for the Laravel application and its dependencies posed some initial challenges. I had to ensure that the containers were properly configured and could communicate with each other.
## 2. Database Connection
Resolving issues related to database connectivity, such as connection refused errors, required troubleshooting and debugging. This involved checking the database configuration, network settings, and container logs to identify and address the root cause of the problem.
## 3. Testing Environment
Setting up a testing environment with PHPUnit and ensuring that the tests ran successfully within the Docker environment required careful configuration and validation.
## 4. Error Handling
Implementing robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle exceptions and errors, such as database connection errors or invalid input data, required careful consideration and testing.
## 5. NuxtJS
Despite a two-year hiatus from Vue.js, I swiftly reacquainted myself with the framework before delving into learning Nuxt.js. Surprisingly, the transition was smoother than anticipated, and I quickly achieved a functional Nuxt.js application. This experience highlighted the importance of adaptability and continuous learning in navigating technological shifts effectively.
